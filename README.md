# Reinforcement-Learning-Journey
I'll describe my journey as I learn reinforcement learning from various resources online from scratch.
# 1. Reinforcement Learning Course by [Thomas Simonini](https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course)
Contains a detailed blog post for each topic, explained really well. Also contains support Youtube tutorials for each topic. Also contains a self explanatory IPython notebook along with each small topic. Uses OPENAI gym environments.
# 2. Skymind.ai RL wiki
Great collection of resources related to RL containing everything from blogs, to videos, papers and implementation.
